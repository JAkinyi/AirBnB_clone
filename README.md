# The AirBnB Project
## Overview

This project of the Holberton SE course curriculum is aimed at building a complete web application by the end of it: the AirBnB clone

    ## Step 1:
    By the end of this first step, we shall have been able to: <br/>
    ***
    * put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances <br/>
    * create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file <br/>
    * create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel <br/>
    * create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: The File storage. <br/>
    * create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine <br/>
    
## The Command Interpretor 

Just like the shell but limited to specific use. 
It is the commandline interface from which we are able to: <br/>
***
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place) <br/>
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc… <br/>
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) <br/>
* Update attributes of an object <br/>
* Destroy an object <br/>

## How to start it
cmd module - is useful for building a custom command interepretor
## How to use it

##Examples
The shell is an example***
