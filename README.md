# The AirBnB Project
## Overview

This project of the Holberton SE course curriculum is aimed at building a complete web application by the end of it: the AirBnB clone
    ## Step 1:
    By the end of this first step, we shall have been able to:
    *put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
    *create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    *create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    *create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: The File storage.
    *create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
##The Command Interpretor
Just like the shell but limited to specific use. 
It is the commandline interface from which we are able to:
*Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
*Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
*Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
*Update attributes of an object
*Destroy an object

## How to start it
cmd module - is useful for building a custom command interepretor
## How to use it

##Examples
The shell is an example***
